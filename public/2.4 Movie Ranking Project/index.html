            This movie was a solid (not perfect) continuation of what I believe to be a 
            very strong movie series reboot. The goal here is clearly to start another trilogy of Apes movies. 
            While I did not find this new one to be quite as captivating from the start as Rise was, they
            did a good job of transporting us forward in time since the end the previous movie and setting a very
            new stage. The plot was straightforward and unoriginal at times, but paced well. The movie introduced 
            strong protagonists and complicated relationships between them, in spite of the lack of a surviving villain.
            All in all, a fun movie that has be excited to see where it goes from here.
